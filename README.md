### Install

~~Add-ons for Firefox: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/myket-apk-downloader/~~

A biased reviewer at Mozilla removed this extension, as well as the 
Cafebazaar.ir extension, on the grounds that it had the same code and 
function as the APK Downloader for the Cafebazaar.ir extension. (This is an 
unprofessional behavior of Mozilla)
